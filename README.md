```bash
git clone https://github.com/howsmyanimeprofilepicture/book-builder

5. And then save your file(`.md`) into the `/${Part}/${Chapter}` directory as below:
```bash
â”€ Part1 â”€â”¬â”€ Chapter1 â”€â”¬â”€ `1.1. Hello, world.md`
         â”‚            â””â”€ `1.2. LaTEX.md`
         â””â”€ Chapter2 â”€â”€â”€ `2.1. Emoji.md`
    
â”€ Part1 â”€â”€â”€ Chapter3 â”€â”€â”€ `3.1. YOLO.md`
```


6. Finally, type the command in your terminal as below:
```bash
node ./book-builder/build.js
